# sizeMetrics
This repo is a staging area for scripts, test data sets, and other artifacts to provide replicability for a research project we are currently undertaking. The goal of this project is to develop effective ways of characterizing a distribution of extragalactic X-ray emission (and potentially at other wavelengths):
(1) with minimal assumptions needed regarding equilibrium status of the gas system, and 
(2) without need for axisymmetric or spatially-contiguous distributions.
